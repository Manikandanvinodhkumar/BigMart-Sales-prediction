# BigMart-Sales-prediction
The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.  Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.   The data has missing values as some stores do not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly. This project ranks the reviews based on the relevance.
